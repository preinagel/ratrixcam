## Overview
<img align="right" width="300" src="./docs/img/RatcamIcon.png"> The ratrixCam system is an inexpensive, bare-bones open-source hardware and software package designed to record video 24 hours a day 7 days a week for at least 1 week continuously, with the minimum possible frame drops within videos or gaps between videos. It was developed for in-home-cage animal behavior monitoring, but could be used in any application requiring continuous uninterrupted video recording. The code provides a minimal graphical user interface that allows the user to monitor the camera status and session statistics during the run. The code is currently verified to support up to 8 cameras streaming at 30fps, 640x480p.

ratrixCam 0.0

The ratrixCam system is an inexpensive, bare-bones open-source hardware and software package designed to record video 24 hours a day 7 days a week for at least 1 week continuously, with the minimum possible frame drops within videos or gaps between videos. It is currently verified to support up to 8 cameras streaming at 30fps, 640x480p. It relies on MacMini hardware, ArduCam USB cameras, high-end USB Hubs, and high-speed, high-capacity external SSD drives. The code provides a minimal graphical user interface that allows the user to monitor the camera status and session statistics continuously during the run.
